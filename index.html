                            <span class="tab"></span>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="tab"></span>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

                            <span class="tab"></span>We are the sum of our experiences. Our personality is unique to our individual selves. It is our past experiences that shape who and what we are today. The books we read, the movies we watch, the things we’ve done and the mistakes and decisions we make are part of who we are today. The way our parents raised us and the environment we grew up in play a big role in what we eventually become. The same holds true for dogs. If the new clone grows up in the same environment as the original dog than the personality will be the same or closely similar.

                            <span class="tab"></span>Our universe is so amazingly beautiful and mysterious. There are so many things about our universe that is so utterly incredible and there are also many things we humans cannot even fathom. Take a moment and think of the little things we do know about our universe. As you sit here reading the words on this page there are radio waves filled with music passing through your body. Transmitted from a radio station to your radio. There are thousands of cell phone conversations that are magically transmit over the air invisibly passing over oceans and land and through your body. We send movies and information digitally through air and cable directly to your television, computer, and smart phone.

                        <p>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Then there is the beauty of mathematics and music. How did we do that? How do we figure out and create things?. How did we come up with songs that evoke emotions. How did we figure out mathematics that are the building blocks for the things we experience everyday. How about the beauty and wonder of our galaxy? The concept of time and distance of life and evolution….and what about love? An emotion so powerful that it makes us humans do things we would never have done without the emotion called love. And what about the trillions of planets spinning in the darkness of space? So beautiful it steals your breath away. With so much we have yet to understand how do we know if the souls of our beloved pets are not with us. Who’s to say that love is just as powerful after death than in life? That the soul of your lost pet is gone forever or perhaps reborn in their clone.
